## Development Process

As a web developer, I built this portfolio from scratch to showcase my abilities and create a positive user experience. Here's a summary of my development process:

1. **Planning:** I started by planning the website's structure and content, considering the essential sections and the information I wanted to present.

4. **JavaScript:** For interactivity and functionality, I added JavaScript to implement smooth scrolling, form validation, and other features.

5. **Testing:** Throughout the development, I tested the portfolio on various browsers and screen sizes to ensure a consistent and bug-free experience.

6. **Optimization:** I optimized the images and code for performance to ensure fast loading times and a smooth user experience.
